-Relationship Modeling:
---------------------------

* Connected Transaction_Data to Customers, Products, and Stores using customer_id, product_id and store_id PK/FK 
* Connected Transaction_Data to Calender by Calender.date <-* Transaction_Data.transaction_date, likewise for Calender.date <-*Transaction_Data.stock_date 
* Connected Returns to Products, Calender, and Stores using product_id, store_id and date as PK/FK 
* Connected Stores to Regions with snowflake schema.


-Validation:
----------------

* All relationships are one-to-many with PK on the lookup side and FK on the data side
* Filters are all one-way.
* Filter contet flows downstream from lookup tables to data tables
* Data tables are connected by shared lookup tables


Organization:
-----------------

* Made all foreign keys in data tables hidden from Report View, and region_id from Stores table hidden

* Changed to short-date format across all tables.
* Changed Product product_retail_price to currency format
* Categorized Customer location fields appropriately as city, postal code, and country.
* Categorized Stores city, country, full_address as City, Country, Address.
